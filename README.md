Clinical codes repository to increase the reliability and validity of medical research.

Researchers and clinicians can enhance disease classifications by using historical code-lists, building upon earlier work and preventing needless duplication of effort.
These lists can be used as a source on their own for future study, such as tracking diseases over time.

Clinical codes, like any other research approach, subject to scrutiny and peer-review.
